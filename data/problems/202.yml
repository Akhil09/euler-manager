:content: "\r\n<p>Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle,
  with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal gap at
  each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Label
  the vertices A, B and C. There are 2 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex
  C, bounce off 11 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below;
  the other is the reverse of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n

  enter at vertex C, bounce off 12017639147 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?</p>\r\n"
