  b ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) c. \r(AB
  = c, BC = a and AC = b).  \n\rThe angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the
  sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_257_bisector.gif)
  \ \n\nThe segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles:
  AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.  \n\rIt can be proven that for each of these four triangles
  the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.  \n\rHowever, there exist triangles
  for which some or all of these ratios are integral.\n\nHow many triangles ABC with
  perimeter ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)100,000,000
  exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?\n\n"
