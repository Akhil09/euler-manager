:name: Investigating multiple reflections of a laser beam
:content: "\r\n<p>In laser physics, a \"white cell\" is a mirror system that acts
  as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on
  the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.</p>\r\n<p>The specific white
  cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>
  + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = 100</p>\r\n<p>The section corresponding to <img src=\"images/symbol_minus.gif\"

  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"><i>x</i> <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\"
  height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> +0.01 at
  the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.</p>\r\n<div
  style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p_144_1.gif\" width=\"268\"
  height=\"240\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"project/images/p_144_2.gif\" width=\"141\" height=\"287\"
  alt=\"\">\n</div>\r\n<p>The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1)
  just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).</p>\r\n<p>Each
  time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of
  reflection \"angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.\" That is, both the
  incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point
  of incidence.</p>\r\n<p>In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first
  two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the
  blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the
  first bounce.</p>\n<p>The slope <i>m</i> of the tangent line at any point (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)
  of the given ellipse is: <i>m</i> = <img src=\"images/symbol_minus.gif\" width=\"9\"
  height=\"3\" alt=\"−\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">4<i>x</i>/<i>y</i></p>\n<p>The
  normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.</p>\r\n<p>The
  animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How
  many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell before exiting?</p>\r\n"
