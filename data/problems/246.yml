:content: "A definition for an ellipse is:  \n\rGiven a circle c with centre M and
  radius r and a point G such that d(G,M) ![<]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_lt.gif)r, the
  locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an ellipse.\n\n\rThe
  construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.\r\r\n ![]({{ images_dir
  }}/p_246_anim.gif)\n\nGiven are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).  \n \rGiven
  is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.  \n\rThe locus of the points
  that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.  \n\rFrom a point P outside
  e the two tangents t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> to the ellipse are drawn.  \n\rLet
  the points where t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> touch the ellipse be R and S.\n\n

  RPS greater than 45 degrees?\n\n"
