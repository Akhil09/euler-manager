- You probably know the game <i>Fifteen Puzzle</i>. Here, instead of numbered tiles,
  we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.
- 'A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right, Up, Down)
  in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (<b>S</b>), by the sequence
  <b>LULUR</b> we reach the configuration (<b>E</b>):'
- ''
- "For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):\r\n"
- For the sequence <b>LULUR</b> given above, the checksum would be 19761398.
- "Now, starting from configuration (<b>S</b>),\r\nfind all shortest ways to reach
  configuration (<b>T</b>)."
- ''
- What is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal length?
