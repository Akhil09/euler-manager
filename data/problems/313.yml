:content: "\r\n<p>In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically
  into an empty space. The objective of the game is to move the red counter from the
  top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always starts in
  the bottom right corner. For example, the following sequence of pictures show how
  the game can be completed in five moves on a 2 by 2 grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img
  src=\"project/images/p_313_sliding_game_1.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let S(m,n) represent
  the minimum number of moves to complete the game on an m by n grid. For example,
  it can be verified that S(5,4) = 25.</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p_313_sliding_game_2.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There
  are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n) = p<sup>2</sup>, where p <img src=\"images/symbol_lt.gif\"
  width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&lt;\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  100 is prime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many grids does S(m,n) = p<sup>2</sup>, where p
  <img src=\"images/symbol_lt.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&lt;\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 10<sup>6</sup> is prime?</p>\r\n"
