:name: 2x2 positive integer matrix
:content:
- "A <i>positive integer matrix</i> is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.<br>\r\nSome
  positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix
  in two different ways. Here is an example:"
- "\r\nWe define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices
  which have a <dfn title=\"the sum of the elements on the main diagonal\">trace</dfn>
  less than <var>N</var> and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer
  matrix in two different ways.<br>\r\nWe can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) =
  1019.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind F(10<sup>7</sup>).\r\n"
