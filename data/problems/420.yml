:content: "\r\n<p>A <i>positive integer matrix</i> is a matrix whose elements are
  all positive integers.<br>\r\nSome positive integer matrices can be expressed as
  a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:</p>\r\n\r\n<div
  align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_420_matrix.gif\">\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe
  define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which
  have a <dfn title=\"the sum of the elements on the main diagonal\">trace</dfn> less
  than <var>N</var> and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix
  in two different ways.<br>\r\nWe can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind
  F(10<sup>7</sup>).\r\n</p>\r\n"
