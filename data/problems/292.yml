- We shall define a <i>pythagorean polygon</i>  to be a <b>convex polygon</b> with
  the following properties:<br>
- "For a given integer <var>n</var>, define P(<var>n</var>) as the number of distinct
  pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\"
  width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <var>n</var>.<br>\r\nPythagorean
  polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another."
- "You are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.<br>\r\nFind P(120)."
