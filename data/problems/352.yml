:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nEach one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare
  virus, known to affect 2% of the sheep population.\r\nAn accurate and extremely
  sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative
  result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBecause
  of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate
  tests, the following procedure can be used instead:<br><br>\r\nThe sheep are split
  into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. \r\nFor each group, the 5 samples are mixed
  together and a single test is performed. Then,\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the result
  is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.</li>\r\n<li>If
  the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for
  each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nSince
  the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test
  (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Negative (and
  no more tests needed) with probability 0.98<sup>5</sup> = 0.9039207968.</li>\r\n<li>Positive
  (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nThus,
  the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\"
  width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  5 = 1.480396016.<br>\r\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average
  of only 1.480396016 <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\"
  alt=\"×\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 5 = <b>7.40198008</b> tests,
  which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough
  the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved
  considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there
  are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We
  may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified
  that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests
  will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of
  the cases.</li>\r\n<li>If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected
  and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test
  on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).</li>\r\n<li>We can try a
  different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting
  those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nTo
  simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place
  when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed
  sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a
  verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start
  examining any other animals.\r\n</p>\r\nFor the current example, it turns out that
  the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the <i>optimal strategy</i>)
  requires an average of just <b>4.155452</b> tests!\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUsing the optimal
  strategy, let T(<var>s</var>,<var>p</var>) represent the average number of tests
  needed to screen a flock of <var>s</var> sheep for a virus having probability <var>p</var>
  to be present in any individual.<br>\r\nThus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25,
  0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind ΣT(10000,
  p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.<br>\r\nGive your answer rounded to six decimal
  places.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n"
