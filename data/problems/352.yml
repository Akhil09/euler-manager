- "\r\nEach one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known
  to affect 2% of the sheep population.\r\nAn accurate and extremely sensitive PCR
  test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but
  it is very time-consuming and expensive.\r\n"
- "\r\nBecause of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing
  25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:<br><br>\r\nThe sheep
  are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. \r\nFor each group, the 5 samples
  are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,\r\n"
- "\r\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the
  first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\r\n"
- "\r\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 <img

  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 5 = 1.480396016.<br>\r\nConsequently, all 5 groups
  can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\"

  5 = <b>7.40198008</b> tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\r\n"
- "\r\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can
  still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive
  and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\r\n"
- "\r\nTo simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction
  we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start
  with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened
  (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before
  we start examining any other animals.\r\n"
- "\r\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T(<var>s</var>,<var>p</var>) represent the
  average number of tests needed to screen a flock of <var>s</var> sheep for a virus
  having probability <var>p</var> to be present in any individual.<br>\r\nThus, rounded
  to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind ΣT(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.<br>\r\nGive your answer
  rounded to six decimal places.\r\n"
