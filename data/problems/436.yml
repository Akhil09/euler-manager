:content: "\r\n<p>Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.<br>\r\nShe
  suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the dishes.<br>\r\nFor
  this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers uniformly distributed
  between 0 and 1.<br>\r\nThe game starts with <var>S</var> = 0.<br>\r\nThe first
  player, Louise, adds to <var>S</var> different random numbers from the generator
  until <var>S</var> &gt; 1 and records her last random number '<var>x</var>'.<br>\r\nThe
  second player, Julie, continues adding to <var>S</var> different random numbers
  from the generator until <var>S</var> &gt; 2 and records her last random number
  '<var>y</var>'.<br>\r\nThe player with the highest number wins and the loser washes
  the dishes, i.e. if <var>y</var> &gt; <var>x</var> the second player wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
  e<var>x</var>ample, if the first player draws 0.62 and 0.44, the first player turn
  ends since 0.62+0.44 &gt; 1 and <var>x</var> = 0.44.<br>\r\nIf the second players
  draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn ends since 0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91
  &gt; 2 and <var>y</var> = 0.91.\r\nSince <var>y</var> &gt; <var>x</var>, the second
  player wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: \"That's
  not fair\".<br>\r\nWhat is the probability that the second player wins?<br>\r\nGive
  your answer rounded to 10 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghij</p>\r\n\r\n"
