:content: "\r\n<p>In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting
  of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. <br>\r\nFor this problem,
  the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from
  PPH. Thus, there are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> distinct proteins consisting of <var>n</var>
  elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always
  folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible,
  since this is energetically advantageous.<br>\r\nAs a result, the H-elements tend
  to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.<br>\r\nNatural
  proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein
  folding in <u>two dimensions</u>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure below shows two possible
  ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with
  red dots).</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p_300_protein.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The
  folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.<br>\r\nOn
  the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal
  for this string.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely
  to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points
  in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850 / 2<sup>8</sup>=3.3203125.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
  is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein
  string of length 15?<br>\r\nGive your answer using as many decimal places as necessary
  for an exact result.</p>\r\n"
