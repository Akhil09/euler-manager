:name: Exploring strings for which only one character comes lexicographically after
  its neighbour to the left
:content: "\r\n<p>Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet,
  character strings of length three can be formed.<br>\r\nExamples are 'abc', 'hat'
  and 'zyx'.<br>\r\nWhen we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters
  come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.<br> \r\nFor 'hat' there
  is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the
  left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its
  neighbour to the left.<br>\r\nIn all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which
  exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.</p>\r\n<p>We
  now consider strings of <var>n</var> <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\"
  height=\"12\" alt=\"â‰¤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 26 different
  characters from the alphabet.<br> \r\nFor every <var>n</var>, p(<var>n</var>) is
  the number of strings of length <var>n</var> for which exactly one character comes
  lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.</p> \r\n<p>What is the maximum
  value of p(<var>n</var>)?</p>\r\n"
