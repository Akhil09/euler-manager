:content: "A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each
  ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_154_pyramid.gif)\n\nThen,
  we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:\n\nA path
  starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly
  below the current position.\n\nConsequently, the number of paths to reach a certain
  position is the sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position,
  there are up to three numbers above it).\n\nThe result is _Pascal's pyramid_ and
  the numbers at each level <var>n</var> are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion
  \r(<var>x + y + z</var>)<sup><var>n</var></sup>.\n\nHow many coefficients in the
  expansion of (<var>x + y + z</var>)<sup>200000</sup> are multiples of 10<sup>12</sup>?\n\n"
