:content:
- A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.
- The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which
  is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies
  the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.
- For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for prime-generation
  consists of the following 14 fractions:<br>
- "Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce
  the sequence:<br>\r\n15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, <b>4</b>, 30, ...,
  136, <b>8</b>, 60, ..., 544, <b>32</b>, 240, ..."
- "The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>,
  2<sup>5</sup>, ...<br>\r\nIt can be shown that <i>all</i> the powers of 2 in this
  sequence have prime exponents and that <i>all</i> the primes appear as exponents
  of powers of 2, in proper order!"
- "If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7 (find
  the 10001<sup>st</sup> prime), how many iterations would be needed until the program
  produces 2<sup>10001st prime</sup> ?\r\n"
