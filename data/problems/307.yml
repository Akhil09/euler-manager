:content: "\r\n<p>\r\n<var>k</var> defects are randomly distributed amongst <var>n</var>
  integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found
  on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet
  p(<var>k,n</var>) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3
  defects.<br>\r\nFor instance p(3,7) <img src=\"images/symbol_asymp.gif\" width=\"11\"
  height=\"9\" alt=\"â‰ˆ\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 0.0204081633.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind
  p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form
  0.abcdefghij\r\n</p>\r\n"
