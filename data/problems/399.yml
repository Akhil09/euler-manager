:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nThe first 15 fibonacci numbers are:<br>\r\n1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.<br>\r\nIt
  can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4 and 144 is divisible
  by 4 and by 9.<br> \r\nSo the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:<br>\r\n1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377
  and 610.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe 200th squarefree fibonacci number is:\r\n971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445.<br>\r\nThe
  last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in scientific notation
  this number can be written as 9.7e53.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind the 100 000 000th squarefree
  fibonacci number.<br>\r\nGive as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by
  a comma followed by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after
  the decimal point).<br>\r\nFor the 200th squarefree number the answer would have
  been: 1608739584170445,9.7e53\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<font size=\"-1\">\r\nNote:<br>
  \r\nFor this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci number
  divisible by p is not divisible by p<sup>2</sup> (this is part of <b>Wall's conjecture</b>).
  This has been verified for primes <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\"
  height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 3·10<sup>15</sup>,
  but has not been proven in general.<br>\r\n\r\nIf it happens that the conjecture
  is false, then the accepted answer to this problem isn't guaranteed to be the 100
  000 000th squarefree fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for
  that number.\r\n</font>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
