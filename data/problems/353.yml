:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nA moon could be described by the sphere C(<var>r</var>) with
  centre (0,0,0) and radius <var>r</var>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are stations
  on the moon at the points on the surface of C(<var>r</var>) with integer coordinates.
  The station at (0,0,<var>r</var>) is called North Pole station, the station at (0,0,-<var>r</var>)
  is called South Pole station.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll stations are connected with
  each other via the shortest road on the great arc through the stations. A journey
  between two stations is risky. If <var>d</var> is the length of the road between
  two stations, (<var>d</var>/(π <var>r</var>))<sup>2</sup> is a measure for the risk
  of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes more
  than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the used roads.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA
  direct journey from  the North Pole station to the South Pole station has the length
  π<var>r</var> and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole
  station via (0,<var>r</var>,0) has the same length, but a smaller risk: (½π<var>r</var>/(π<var>r</var>))<sup>2</sup>+(½π<var>r</var>/(π<var>r</var>))<sup>2</sup>=0.5.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe
  minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station
  on C(<var>r</var>) is M(<var>r</var>).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou are given that
  M(7)=0.1784943998  rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind
