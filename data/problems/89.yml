:content: "\r\n<p>The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing
  each number (see <a href=\"about=roman_numerals\">About Roman Numerals...</a>).
  However, there is always a \"best\" way of writing a particular number.</p>\r\n<p>For
  example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number
  sixteen:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;font-family:courier new,monospace;\">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br>\r\nVIIIIIIIIIII<br>\r\nVVIIIIII<br>\r\nXIIIIII<br>\r\nVVVI<br>\r\nXVI</p>\r\n<p>The
  last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number of
  numerals.</p>\r\n<p>The 11K text file, <a href=\"project/roman.txt\">roman.txt</a>
  (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written
  in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged
  in descending units and obey the subtractive pair rule (see <a href=\"about=roman_numerals\">About
  Roman Numerals...</a> for the definitive rules for this problem).</p>\r\n<p>Find
  the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.</p>\r\n<p
  class=\"note\">Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain
  no more than four consecutive identical units.</p>\r\n\r\n"
