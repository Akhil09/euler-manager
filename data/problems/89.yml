:content: "The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each
  number (see [About Roman Numerals...](about=roman_numerals)). However, there is
  always a \"best\" way of writing a particular number.\n\nFor example, the following
  represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:\n\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
  \ \n\rVIIIIIIIIIII  \n\rVVIIIIII  \n\rXIIIIII  \n\rVVVI  \n\rXVI\n\nThe last example
  being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.\n\nThe
  11K text file, [roman.txt](project/roman.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target
  As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal,
  Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units and obey the subtractive
  pair rule (see [About Roman Numerals...](about=roman_numerals) for the definitive
  rules for this problem).\n\nFind the number of characters saved by writing each
  of these in their minimal form.\n\nNote: You can assume that all the Roman numerals
  in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.\n\n"
