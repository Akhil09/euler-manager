:content: "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
  two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:\n\n1, 2, 3, 5,
  8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n\nBy considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
  whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.\n\n<!--\r\nNote:
