- 'Suppliers ''A'' and ''B'' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury
  hamper market:'
- ''
- Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there
  is inevitably some spoilage - <i>i.e.</i> products gone bad.
- 'The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:'
- To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage
  rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage
  rates), <var>m</var>&gt;1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was
  worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of <var>m</var>.
- There are thirty-five <var>m</var><img src="images/symbol_gt.gif" width="10" height="10"
  alt="&gt;" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;">1 for which this surprising
  result could have occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.
- "What's the largest possible value of <var>m</var>?<br>\r\nGive your answer as a
  fraction reduced to its lowest terms, in the form <var>u</var>/<var>v</var>."
