  'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\n<center><table

  the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably
  some spoilage - <i>i.e.</i> products gone bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suppliers compare
  their performance using two types of statistic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The five <i>per-product
  spoilage rates</i> for each supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad
  divided by the number of products supplied, for each of the five products in turn.</li>\r\n
  \ <li>The <i>overall spoilage rate</i> for each supplier is equal to the total number
  of products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by that supplier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To
  their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates
  was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates),
  <var>m</var>&gt;1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for
  'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of <var>m</var>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are thirty-five
  <var>m</var><img src=\"images/symbol_gt.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&gt;\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">1 for which this surprising result
  could have occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What's the
  largest possible value of <var>m</var>?<br>\r\nGive your answer as a fraction reduced
  to its lowest terms, in the form <var>u</var>/<var>v</var>.</p>\r\n"
