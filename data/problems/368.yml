- "\r\n"
- "\r\nIf we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a
  9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.<br>\r\nThis
  modified harmonic series is called the <b>Kempner</b> series.\r\n"
- "\r\nLet us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic
  series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.\r\nOne
  can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms
  will be omitted.<br>\r\nThese 20 omitted terms are:\r\n"
- "\r\nThis series converges as well.\r\n"
- " \r\nFind the value the series converges to.<br>\r\nGive your answer rounded to
  10 digits behind the decimal point.\r\n"
