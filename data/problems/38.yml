:content: "Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:\n\n> 192 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  1 = 192  \n> \r192 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  2 = 384  \n> \r192 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)
  3 = 576\n\nBy concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576.
  We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)\n\nThe same can
  be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the
  pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).\n\nWhat
  is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated
  product of an integer with (1,2, ... , <var>n</var>) where <var>n</var> ![>](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_gt.gif)
  1?\n\n"
