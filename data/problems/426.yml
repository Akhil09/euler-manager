:content:
- "\r\nConsider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For example,
  an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2 empty boxes,
  2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted by the sequence
  (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear
  alternately.\r\n"
- "\r\nA turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following
  rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box
  to its right.\r\n"
- "\r\nAfter one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can
  be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied
  box.\r\n"
- "\r\nA system like this is called a <b>Box-Ball System</b> or <b>BBS</b> for short.\r\n"
- "\r\nIt can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves
  to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the
  example below, the consecutive numbers of <b>occupied boxes</b> evolves to [1, 2,
  3]; we shall call this the final state.\r\n"
- "\r\nWe define the sequence {<var>t</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>}:<br>"
- "\r\nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>,
  …, <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>), the final state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].<br>\r\nStarting
  from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>,
  …, <var>t</var><sub>10 000 000</sub>), find the final state.<br>\r\nGive as your
  answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state. For example, if
  the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>)
  is your answer.\r\n"
