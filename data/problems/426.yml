:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nConsider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain
  a ball. For example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed
  by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted
  by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and
  empty boxes appear alternately.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA turn consists of moving each
  ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which
  has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter
  one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below;
  note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div
  align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_426_baxball1.gif\">\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA
  system like this is called a <b>Box-Ball System</b> or <b>BBS</b> for short.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt
  can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state
  where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below,
  the consecutive numbers of <b>occupied boxes</b> evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall
  call this the final state.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_426_baxball2.gif\">\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe
  define the sequence {<var>t</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>}:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<var>s</var><sub>0</sub>
  = 290797\r\n</li>\n<li>\n<var>s</var><sub><var>k</var>+1</sub> = <var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub><sup>2</sup>
  mod 50515093\r\n</li>\n<li>\n<var>t</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> = (<var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub>
  mod 64) + 1\r\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>,
  <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>), the final state becomes
  [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].<br>\r\nStarting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>,
  <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10 000 000</sub>), find the final
  state.<br>\r\nGive as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the
  final state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1<sup>2</sup>
  + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>) is your answer.\r\n</p>\r\n"
