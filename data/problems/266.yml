- "\r\nThe divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.<br>\r\nThe largest divisor of 12
  that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.<br>\r\nWe shall call the largest
  divisor of an integer <var>n</var> that does not exceed the square root of <var>n</var>
  the pseudo square root (PSR) of <var>n</var>.<br>\r\nIt can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.\r\n"
