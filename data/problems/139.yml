:content: "\r\n<p>Let (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) represent the three sides of
  a right angle triangle with integral length sides. It is possible to place four
  such triangles together to form a square with length <i>c</i>.</p>\r\n<p>For example,
  (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5 square with a 1 by 1
  hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5 square can be tiled with twenty-five
  1 by 1 squares.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_139.gif\"
  width=\"400\" height=\"180\" alt=\"\">\n</div>\r\n<p>However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles
  were used then the hole would measure 7 by 7 and these could not be used to tile
  the 13 by 13 square.</p>\r\n<p>Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is
  less than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a
  tiling to take place?</p>\r\n\r\n"
