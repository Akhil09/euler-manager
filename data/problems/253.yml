- A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each
  with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers
  1 to 40 in order.
- Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that
  have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places
  them in the correct order.<br> As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms
  distinct segments that gradually merge together.<br> The number of segments starts
  at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then
  tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).
- "\r\n\r\n"
- 'For example:'
- "Let <var>M</var> be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random
  tidy-up of the caterpillar.<br>\r\nFor a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of
  possibilities for each <var>M</var> is"
- so the most likely value of <var>M</var> is 3 and the average value is <sup>385643</sup>⁄<sub>113400</sub>
  = 3.400732, rounded to six decimal places.
- The most likely value of <var>M</var> for a forty-piece caterpillar is 11; but what
  is the average value of <var>M</var>?
- Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.
