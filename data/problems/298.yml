- Larry and Robin play a memory game involving of a sequence of random numbers between
  1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each player can remember
  up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player
  is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory,
  removing another number if his memory is full.
- "Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers
  to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove:<br>\r\nLarry's
  strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time.<br>\r\nRobin's
  strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time."
- Example game:<br>
- Denoting Larry's score by <var>L</var> and Robin's score by <var>R</var>, what is
  the expected value of |<var>L</var>-<var>R</var>| after 50 turns? Give your answer
  rounded to eight decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxxx .
