- "\r\nA game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a player
  removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones she removes
  must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.\r\n"
- "\r\nE.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in
  the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove
  6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.\r\n"
- "\r\nThe player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.\r\n"
- "\r\nA <i>winning configuration</i> is one where the first player can force a win.
  For example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first
  player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.\r\n"
- "\r\nA <i>losing configuration</i> is one where the second player can force a win,
  no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations:
  any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.\r\n"
- "\r\nDefine S(<var>N</var>) as the sum of (<var>x</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>+<var>y</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>)
  for all losing configurations (<var>x</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>,<var>y</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>),

  We can verify that S(10) = 211 and S(10<sup>4</sup>) = 230312207313.\r\n"
