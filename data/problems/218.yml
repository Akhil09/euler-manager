:content: "Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.\rThe
  area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
  \ \n\rMoreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.
  \ \n\rAlso c is a perfect square.\n\nWe will call a right angled triangle perfect
  if  \n\r-it is a primitive right angled triangle  \n\r-its hypotenuse is a perfect
  square\n\nWe will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if  \n\r-it is a perfect
  right angled triangle and  \n\r-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6
  and 28.\n\nHow many perfect right-angled triangles with c ![â‰¤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)10<sup>16</sup>
  exist that are not super-perfect?\n\n"
