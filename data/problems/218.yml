:content: "\r\n<p>Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.\r\nThe
  area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.<br>\r\nMoreover
  it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.<br>\r\nAlso
  c is a perfect square.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will call a right angled triangle perfect
  if<br>\r\n-it is a primitive right angled triangle<br>\r\n-its hypotenuse is a perfect
  square</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if<br>\r\n-it
  is a perfect right angled triangle and<br>\r\n-its area is a multiple of the perfect
  numbers 6 and 28.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many perfect right-angled triangles with
  c<img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"â‰¤\" border=\"0\"
