:name: Rectangles in cross-hatched grids
:content: "\r\n<p>In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles
  could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img
  src=\"project/images/p_147.gif\" width=\"361\" height=\"176\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<p>There
  are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important,
  i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following
  number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:</p>\r\n<p>1x1:
  1\r\n<br>2x1: 4\r\n<br>3x1: 8\r\n<br>1x2: 4\r\n<br>2x2: 18</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding
  those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated
  within 3x2 and smaller grids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many different rectangles could
  be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?</p>\r\n"
