:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nConsider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.<br>\r\nEvery
  number from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of distinct divisors
  of 6:<br>\r\n1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.<br>\r\nA number <var>n</var> is
  called a practical number if every number from 1 up to and including <var>n</var>
  can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of <var>n</var>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA
  pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called a sexy pair
  (since \"sex\" is the Latin word for \"six\"). The first sexy pair is (23, 29).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe
  may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy prime pairs,
  such that the second member of each pair is the first member of the next pair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe
  shall call a number <var>n</var> such that :\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(<var>n</var>-9,
  <var>n</var>-3), (<var>n</var>-3,<var>n</var>+3), (<var>n</var>+3, <var>n</var>+9)
  form a triple-pair, and \r\n</li>\n<li>the numbers <var>n</var>-8, <var>n</var>-4,
  <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>+4 and <var>n</var>+8 are all practical,\r\n</li>\n</ul>
  \r\nan engineers’ paradise.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind the sum of the first four engineers’
  paradises.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
