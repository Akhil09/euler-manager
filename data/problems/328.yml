- "We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2,
  ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. \r\nEach number (question) we ask, has a
  <u>cost equal to the number asked</u> and we get one of three possible answers:<br>"
- Given the value of <var>n</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total
  cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) <u>for the worst possible case</u>.
  E.g.
- If <var>n</var>=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "<b>2</b>".
  The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost =
  2).
- "If <var>n</var>=8, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy:
  Our first question would be \"<b>4</b>\" and if the hidden number is higher than
  4 we will need one or two additional questions.<br>\r\nLet our second question be
  \"<b>6</b>\". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third
  question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.<br>\r\nThus, our third question
  will be \"<b>7</b>\" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=<span
  style=\"color:red;\"><b>17</b></span>."
- "We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for <var>n</var>=8, by asking \"<b>5</b>\"
  as our first question.<br>\r\nIf we are told that the hidden number is higher than
  5, our second question will be \"<b>7</b>\", then we'll know for certain what the
  hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=<span style=\"color:blue;\"><b>12</b></span>).<br>\r\nIf
  we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be
  \"<b>3</b>\" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be
  \"<b>1</b>\", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=<span style=\"color:blue;\"><b>9</b></span>.<br>\r\nSince
  <span style=\"color:blue;\"><b>12</b></span>&gt;<span style=\"color:blue;\"><b>9</b></span>,
  the worst-case cost for this strategy is <span style=\"color:red;\"><b>12</b></span>.
  That's better than what we achieved previously with the \"binary search\" strategy;
  it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.<br>\r\nSo, in fact, we have
  just described an optimal strategy for <var>n</var>=8."
- "Let C(<var>n</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for
  <var>n</var>, as described above.<br>\r\nThus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8)
  = 12.<br>\r\nSimilarly, C(100) = 400 and <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"project/images/p_328_sum1.gif\">C(<var>n</var>)
  = 17575."
