- 'Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users:'
- 'The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record n are Caller(n)
  = S<sub>2n-1</sub> and Called(n) = S<sub>2n</sub> where S<sub>1,2,3,...</sub> come
  from the "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":'
- "For 1 <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> k <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\"
  height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 55, S<sub>k</sub>
  = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k<sup>3</sup>] (modulo 1000000)<br>\r\nFor 56 <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\"

- If Caller(n) = Called(n) then the user is assumed to have misdialled and the call
  fails; otherwise the call is successful.
- From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users X and Y are friends
  if X calls Y or vice-versa. Similarly, X is a friend of a friend of Z if X is a
  friend of Y and Y is a friend of Z; and so on for longer chains.
- The Prime Minister's phone number is 524287. After how many successful calls, not
  counting misdials, will 99% of the users (including the PM) be a friend, or a friend
  of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?
