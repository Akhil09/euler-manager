:content: "\r\n<p>A group of <var>p</var> people decide to sit down at a round table
  and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned,
  unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize
  ranging anywhere from £1 to £<var>p</var>, with no two tickets alike. The goal of
  the game is for each person to maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An
  arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each
  player has only one of two options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The player can scratch his
  ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.<br>\r\n2. The player can trade
  his unscratched ticket for a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leave
  the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches his newly-acquired
  ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game ends
  once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must
  leave with their currently-held tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assume that each player uses
  the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of his ticket winnings. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let
  E(<var>p</var>) represent the expected number of players left at the table when
  the game ends in a game consisting of <var>p</var> players (e.g. E(111) = 5.2912
  when rounded to 5 significant digits).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let S<sub>1</sub>(<var>N</var>)
  = <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"project/images/p444_sum.png\"> E(<var>p</var>)<br>\r\nLet
  S<sub><var>k</var></sub>(<var>N</var>) = <img style=\"vertical-align:middle\" src=\"project/images/p444_sum.png\">
  S<sub><var>k</var>-1</sub>(<var>p</var>) for <var>k</var> <img src=\"images/symbol_gt.gif\"
  width=\"10\" height=\"10\" alt=\"&gt;\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find S<sub>20</sub>(10<sup>14</sup>) and write the answer in scientific
  notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa
  and exponent (e.g. S<sub>3</sub>(100) = 5.983679014e5).</p>\r\n\r\n"
