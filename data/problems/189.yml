:name: Tri-colouring a triangular grid
:content: "\r\n<p>Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:</p>\r\n\r\n<div
  style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"project/images/p_189_grid.gif\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We
  wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green
  or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring
  shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share
  an edge.<br>\r\nNote: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.</p>
  \r\n\r\n<p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>\r\n<div
  style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"project/images/p_189_colours.gif\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A
  colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered
  <i>distinct</i> from C unless the two are identical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many distinct
  valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>\r\n\r\n"
