:content: "For any triangle <var>T</var> in the plane, it can be shown that there
  is a unique ellipse with largest area that is completely inside <var>T</var>.\n\n![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_385_ellipsetriangle.png)\n\nFor
  a given <var>n</var>, consider triangles <var>T</var> such that:  \n\r- the vertices
  of <var>T</var> have integer coordinates with absolute value ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)
  n, and   \n\r- the **foci** <sup>1</sup> of the largest-area ellipse inside <var>T</var>
  are ( ![√](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_radic.gif)13,0)
  and (- ![√](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_radic.gif)13,0).
  \ \n\rLet A(<var>n</var>) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.\n\nFor
  example, if <var>n</var> = 8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are (-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0)
  and (4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0), and the area of each triangle is 36. Thus A(8) = 36 + 36
  = 72.\n\nIt can be verified that A(10) = 252, A(100) = 34632 and A(1000) = 3529008.\n\nFind
  A(1 000 000 000).\n\n<sup>1</sup>The **foci** (plural of **focus** ) of an ellipse
  are two points A and B such that for every point P on the boundary of the ellipse,
  <var>AP</var> + <var>PB</var> is constant.\n\n"
