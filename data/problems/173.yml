:name: Using up to one million tiles how many different "hollow" square laminae can
  be formed?
:content: "\r\n<p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
  \"hole\" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example,
  using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:</p>\r\n<div
  style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_173_square_laminas.gif\"
  alt=\"\">\n</div>\r\n<p>With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of
  the tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.</p>\r\n<p>Using
  up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be formed?</p>\r\n"
