:content: "An m ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)n maze is an m ![×]({{ images_dir
  }}/symbol_times.gif)n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells such
  that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other square.   \nThe
  following are examples of a 9 ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)12 maze and
  a 15 ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)20 maze:\n\n![]({{ images_dir }}/p_380_mazes.gif)\n\nLet
  C(m,n) be the number of distinct m ![×]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_times.gif)n mazes.
  Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered
  distinct.\n\nIt can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and
  C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).  \n\rFind
  C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant
  digits.\n\nWhen giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.\rE.g.
  if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.\n\n"
