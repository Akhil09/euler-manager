:content: "Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three vertices.\rConsider
  all integer sided triangles for which the radius of the circumscribed circle is
  integral as well.\n\nLet S(<var>n</var>) be the sum of the radii of the circumscribed
  circles of all such triangles for which the radius does not exceed <var>n</var>.\n\nS(100)=4950
  and S(1200)=1653605.\n\nFind S(10<sup>7</sup>).\n\n"
