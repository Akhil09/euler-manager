- "\r\nConsider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:\r\n"
- "\r\nDie A: 1 4 4 4 4 4<br>\r\nDie B: 2 2 2 5 5 5<br>\r\nDie C: 3 3 3 3 3 6<br>"
- "\r\nA game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player
  who rolls the highest value wins.\r\n"
- "\r\nIf the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get<br>\r\nP(second
  player wins) = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>"
- "\r\nIf the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get<br>\r\nP(second
  player wins) = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>"
- "\r\nIf the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get<br>\r\nP(second
  player wins) = <sup>25</sup>/<sub>36</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>"
- "\r\nSo whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another
  die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.<br>\r\nA set of dice having this
  property is called a <b>nontransitive set of dice</b>.\r\n"
- "\r\nWe wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume
  the following conditions:"
- "\r\nFor <var>N</var> = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.<br>\r\nHow many are
  there for <var>N</var> = 30 ?\r\n"
