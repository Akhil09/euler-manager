- 'The binomial coefficients <sup>n</sup>C<sub>k</sub> can be arranged in triangular
  form, Pascal''s triangle, like this:'
- 'It can be seen that the first eight rows of Pascal''s triangle contain twelve distinct
  numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 21 and 35.'
- "A positive integer <var>n</var> is called squarefree if no square of a prime divides
  <var>n</var>.\r\nOf the twelve distinct numbers in the first eight rows of Pascal's
  triangle, all except 4 and 20 are squarefree.\r\nThe sum of the distinct squarefree
  numbers in the first eight rows is 105."
- Find the sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first 51 rows of Pascal's
  triangle.
