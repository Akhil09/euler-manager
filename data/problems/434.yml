:content: "\r\n<p>Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting
  the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.<br>\r\nGraphs
  can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the
  Euclidean space.<br>\r\nA <strong>flexible</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph
  where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance
  between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between
  each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.<br>\r\nA <strong>rigid</strong>
  graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.<br>\r\nInformally, a graph
  is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with
  rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently
  from the rest of the graph.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>grid graphs</strong> embedded
  in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:<br><img
  src=\"project/images/p434_rigid.gif\"></p>\r\n<p>However, one can make them rigid
  by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there
  are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:<br><img src=\"project/images/p434_rigid23.png\"></p>\r\n<p>Note
  that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation
  of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of
  making a grid graph rigid.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Let <var>R</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>)
  be the number of ways to make the <var>m</var> <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\"
  width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"><var>n</var>
  grid graph rigid. <br>\r\nE.g. <var>R</var>(2,3) = 19 and <var>R</var>(5,5) = 23679901\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Define
  <var>S</var>(<var>N</var>) as <img src=\"images/symbol_sum.gif\" width=\"11\" height=\"14\"
  alt=\"∑\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"><var>R</var>(<var>i</var>,<var>j</var>)

  width=\"10\" height=\"12\" alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"><var>N</var>.<br>\r\nE.g.
  <var>S</var>(5) = 25021721.<br>\r\nFind <var>S</var>(100), give your answer modulo
