:content: "\r\n<p>Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle
  such that each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do
  not overlap. There are four uncovered \"gaps\" which are to be filled iteratively
  with more tangent circles.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n<img src=\"project/images/p_199_circles_in_circles.gif\"
  alt=\"\">\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nAt each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed
  in each gap, which creates more gaps for the next iteration. After 3 iterations
  (pictured), there are 108 gaps and the fraction of the area which is not covered
  by circles is 0.06790342, rounded to eight decimal places.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat
  fraction of the area is not covered by circles after 10 iterations?<br>\r\nGive
  your answer rounded to eight decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxxx .\r\n</p>\r\n"
