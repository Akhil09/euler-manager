:name: Sum of a square and a cube
:content: "\r\n<p>Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube.
  Some of them in more than one way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the palindromic numbers
  that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in
  <b>exactly</b> 4 different ways.<br>\r\nFor example, 5229225 is a palindromic number
  and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:</p>\r\n<p>2285<sup>2</sup>
  + 20<sup>3</sup><br>\r\n2223<sup>2</sup> + 66<sup>3</sup><br>\r\n1810<sup>2</sup>
  + 125<sup>3</sup><br>\r\n1197<sup>2</sup> + 156<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n \r\n<p>Find
  the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n"
