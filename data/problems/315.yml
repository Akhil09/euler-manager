- "Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital root\"
  clocks.<br>\r\nA digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots
  step by step."
- "When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation,
  showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.<br>\r\nFor example,
  if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: \"<b>137</b>\" <img src=\"images/symbol_maps.gif\"
  width=\"15\" height=\"7\" alt=\"→\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  \"<b>11</b>\" <img src=\"images/symbol_maps.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"7\" alt=\"→\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> \"<b>2</b>\" and then it will go
  black, waiting for the next number."
- "Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle,
  bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).<br>\r\nNumber
  \"<b>1</b>\" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number \"<b>4</b>\"
  is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right.
  Number \"<b>8</b>\" lights them all."
- "The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.<br>\r\nTo turn
  on a \"<b>2</b>\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"<b>7</b>\" will cost only 4
  transitions."
- Sam and Max built two different clocks.
- "Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"<b>137</b>\", then the panel
  is turned off, then the next number (\"<b>11</b>\") is turned on, then the panel
  is turned off again and finally the last number (\"<b>2</b>\") is turned on and,
  after some time, off.<br>\r\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:<br>"
- "Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart
  enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.<br>\r\nFor
  number 137, Max's clock requires:<br>"
- "Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.<br>\r\nThe two clocks
  are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10<sup>7</sup> and B = 2<img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\"
  width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">10<sup>7</sup>.
  <br>\r\nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's
  clock and that needed by Max's one."
