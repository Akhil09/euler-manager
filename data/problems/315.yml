  and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital root\" clocks.<br>\r\nA
  digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
  a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation,
  showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.<br>\r\nFor example,
  if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: \"<b>137</b>\" <img src=\"images/symbol_maps.gif\"
  width=\"15\" height=\"7\" alt=\"→\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">
  \"<b>11</b>\" <img src=\"images/symbol_maps.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"7\" alt=\"→\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> \"<b>2</b>\" and then it will go
  black, waiting for the next number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every digital number consists
  of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical
  (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).<br>\r\nNumber \"<b>1</b>\" is
  made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number \"<b>4</b>\" is made by middle
  horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number \"<b>8</b>\"
  lights them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clocks consume energy only when segments are
  turned on/off.<br>\r\nTo turn on a \"<b>2</b>\" will cost 5 transitions, while a
  \"<b>7</b>\" will cost only 4 transitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sam and Max built two different
  clocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"<b>137</b>\",
  then the panel is turned off, then the next number (\"<b>11</b>\") is turned on,
  then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (\"<b>2</b>\") is
  turned on and, after some time, off.<br>\r\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam's
  clock requires:<br></p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\"<b>137</b>\"</td>\r\n<td>:</td>\r\n<td>(2
  + 5 + 4) <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 2 = 22 transitions (\"<b>137</b>\"
  on/off).</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\"<b>11</b>\"</td>\r\n<td>:</td>\r\n<td>(2 + 2)
  <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 2 = 8 transitions (\"<b>11</b>\" on/off).</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\"<b>2</b>\"</td>\r\n<td>:</td>\r\n<td>(5)
  <img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"×\" border=\"0\"
  style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> 2 = 10 transitions (\"<b>2</b>\" on/off).</td>\r\n</tr>\n</table>\r\nFor
  a grand total of 40 transitions.\r\n\r\n<p>Max's clock works differently. Instead
  of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments
  that won't be needed for the next number.<br>\r\nFor number 137, Max's clock requires:<br></p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\"<b>137</b>\"<br><br>\n</td>\r\n<td>:<br><br>\n</td>\r\n<td>2
  + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\"<b>137</b>\" on)<br>\r\n7 transitions (to turn off the
  segments that are not needed for number \"<b>11</b>\").</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\"<b>11</b>\"<br><br><br>\n</td>\r\n<td>:<br><br><br>\n</td>\r\n<td>0
  transitions (number \"<b>11</b>\" is already turned on correctly)<br>\r\n3 transitions
  (to turn off the first \"<b>1</b>\" and the bottom part of the second \"<b>1</b>\";
  <br>\r\nthe top part is common with number \"<b>2</b>\").</td>\r\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\"<b>2</b>\"<br><br>\n</td>\r\n<td>:<br><br>\n</td>\r\n<td>4
  tansitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a \"<b>2</b>\")<br>\r\n5
  transitions (to turn off number \"<b>2</b>\").</td>\r\n</tr>\n</table>\r\nFor a
  grand total of 30 transitions.\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Max's clock consumes less power
  than Sam's one.<br>\r\nThe two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A =
  10<sup>7</sup> and B = 2<img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\"
  alt=\"×\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">10<sup>7</sup>. <br>\r\nFind
  the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and
  that needed by Max's one.</p>\r\n\r\n"
