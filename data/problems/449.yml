:content:
- "Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy
  centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation: b<sup>2</sup><var>x</var><sup>2</sup>
  + b<sup>2</sup><var>y</var><sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup><var>z</var><sup>2</sup>
  = a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>.\r\n"
- "\r\nPhil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with
  a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind the amount of chocolate in mm<sup>3</sup> required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm.
  Give your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point."
