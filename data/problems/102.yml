  -1000 ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) _x_,
  _y_ ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif) 1000,
  such that a triangle is formed.\n\nConsider the following two triangles:\n\nA(-340,495),
  B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)  \n  \n  \nX(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)\n\nIt
  can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does
  not.\n\nUsing [triangles.txt](project/triangles.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target
  As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand \"random\"
  triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.\n\nNOTE:
  The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given
  above.\n\n"
