:content: "\r\n<p>A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.<br> By considering
  two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities:<br> \r\nthe segments
  have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover
  when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that
  common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common
  point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior
  point of both segments.<br>\r\nWe will call a common point T of two segments L<sub>1</sub>
  and L<sub>2</sub> a true intersection point of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>  if
  T is the only common point of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>  and T is an interior
  point of both segments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Consider the three segments L<sub>1</sub>,
  L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:20px;\">L<sub>1</sub>:
  (27, 44) to (12, 32)<br>\r\nL<sub>2</sub>: (46, 53) to (17, 62)<br>\r\nL<sub>3</sub>:
  (46, 70) to (22, 40)</p>\r\n<p>It can be verified that line segments L<sub>2</sub>
  and L<sub>3</sub> have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the
  end points of L<sub>3</sub>: (22,40) lies on L<sub>1</sub> this is not considered
  to be a true point of intersection. L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> have no common
  point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.</p>\r\n<p>Now
  let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000 numbers
  using the so-called \"Blum Blum Shub\" pseudo-random number generator.</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"margin-left:50px;\">s<sub>0</sub> = 290797<br><br>\r\ns<sub>n+1</sub> =
  s<sub>n</sub><img src=\"images/symbol_times.gif\" width=\"9\" height=\"9\" alt=\"Ã—\"
  border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">s<sub>n</sub> (modulo 50515093)<br><br>\r\nt<sub>n</sub>
  = s<sub>n</sub> (modulo 500)</p>\r\n<p>To create each line segment, we use four
  consecutive numbers t<sub>n</sub>. That is, the first line segment is given by:</p>\r\n<p>(t<sub>1</sub>,
  t<sub>2</sub>) to (t<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>4</sub>)</p>\r\n<p>The first four numbers
  computed according to the above generator should be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first
  segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).</p>\r\n<p>How many distinct true intersection
  points are found among the 5000 line segments?</p>\r\n\r\n"
