:content: "\r\n<p>The following equation represents the <i>continuous</i> topography
  of a mountainous region, giving the <dfn title=\"height above sea level\">elevation</dfn>
  <var>h</var> at any point (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>):</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<img
  src=\"project/images/p_262_formula1.gif\"><br>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A mosquito intends
  to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without leaving the area given by 0 ≤ <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> ≤ 1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because
  of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a point A', having elevation
  <var>f</var>. Then, while remaining at the same elevation <var>f</var>, it flies
  around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B' directly above B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First,
  determine <var>f<sub>min</sub></var> which is the minimum constant elevation allowing
  such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.<br>\r\nThen, find
  the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while flying at that constant
  elevation <var>f<sub>min</sub></var>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Give that length as your answer,
  rounded to three decimal places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><font><u>Note</u>: For convenience,
  the elevation function shown above is repeated below, in a form suitable for most
  programming languages:<br>\r\nh=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y) ) * exp( -abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7)
  )</font></p>\r\n\r\n"
