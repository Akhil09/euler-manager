  for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has the
  two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6.\rWe shall call
  a real number <var>x</var> _ambiguous_, if there is at least one denominator bound
  for which <var>x</var> possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous
  number is necessarily rational.\n\nHow many ambiguous numbers <var>x</var> = <var>p</var>/<var>q</var>,\r0
