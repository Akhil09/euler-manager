- "\r\nThe above is an example of a cryptic kakuro (also known as cross sums, or even
  sums cross) puzzle, with its final solution on the right. (The common rules of kakuro
  puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet sites. Other related information
  can also be currently found at <a href=\"http://krazydad.com/\">krazydad.com</a>
  whose author has provided the puzzle data for this challenge.)\r\n"

- "\r\nThe downloadable text file (<a href=\"project/kakuro200.txt\">kakuro200.txt</a>)
  contains the description of 200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first
  puzzle in the file is the above example which is coded as follows:\r\n"
- "\r\n6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X\r\n"
- "\r\nThe first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information
  grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle)
  followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed to insert
  information.\r\n"
- "\r\nThe content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left
  to right and starting with the top line.<br>\r\nX = Gray cell, not required to be
  filled by a digit.<br>\r\nO (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by
  a digit.<br>\r\nA = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced
  by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.<br>\r\n( ) = Location of the encrypted
  sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case \"h\" and vertical sums are preceded
  by a lower case \"v\". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending
  if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first
  letter would be for the \"tens\" and the second one for the \"units\". When the
  cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first
  one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within
  the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately
  followed by a comma.\r\n"
- "\r\nThe description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed
  (CRLF) instead of a comma.\r\n"
- "\r\nThe required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter necessary
  to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As indicated
  under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9 out of the
  10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description. When only 9 are
  given, the missing one must be assigned the remaining digit.\r\n"
- "\r\nYou are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in the file
  is 64414157580.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind the sum of the answers for the 200 puzzles.\r\n"
