- "\r\nJeff eats a pie in an unusual way.<br>\r\nThe pie is circular. He starts with
  slicing an initial cut in the pie along a radius.<br>\r\nWhile there is at least
  a given fraction <var>F</var> of pie left, he performs the following procedure:<br>\r\n-
  He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is remaining of the
  pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely. This will divide
  the remaining pie into three pieces.<br> \r\n- Going counterclockwise from the initial
  cut, he takes the first two pie pieces and eats them.<br>\r\nWhen less than a fraction
  <var>F</var> of pie remains, he does not repeat this procedure. Instead, he eats
  all of the remaining pie.\r\n"
