:content: "Jeff eats a pie in an unusual way.  \n\rThe pie is circular. He starts
  with slicing an initial cut in the pie along a radius.  \n\rWhile there is at least
  a given fraction <var>F</var> of pie left, he performs the following procedure:
  \ \n\r- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is remaining
  of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely. This will
  divide the remaining pie into three pieces.  \n \r- Going counterclockwise from
  the initial cut, he takes the first two pie pieces and eats them.  \n\rWhen less
  than a fraction <var>F</var> of pie remains, he does not repeat this procedure.
  Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.\n\n![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_394_eatpie.gif)\n\nFor
  <var>x</var> ![≥](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_ge.gif)
  1, let E(<var>x</var>) be the expected number of times Jeff repeats the procedure
  above with <var>F</var> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub><var>x</var></sub>.  \n\rIt can be verified
  that E(1) = 1, E(2) ![≈](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_asymp.gif)
  1.2676536759, and E(7.5) ![≈](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_asymp.gif)
  2.1215732071.\n\nFind E(40) rounded to 10 decimal places behind the decimal point.\n\n"
