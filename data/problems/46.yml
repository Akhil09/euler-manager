:content: "It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can
  be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.\n\n9 = 7 + 2 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)1<sup>2</sup>

  turns out that the conjecture was false.\n\nWhat is the smallest odd composite that
  cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?\n\n"
