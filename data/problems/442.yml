:name: Eleven-free integers
:content:
- An integer is called <i>eleven-free</i> if its decimal expansion does not contain
  any substring representing a power of 11 except 1.
- For example, 2404 and 13431 are eleven-free, while 911 and 4121331 are not.
- Let E(<i>n</i>) be the <i>n</i>th positive eleven-free integer. For example, E(3)
  = 3, E(200) = 213 and E(500Â 000) = 531563.
- Find E(10<sup>18</sup>).
