:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nTwo positive numbers A and B are said to be <i>connected</i>
  (denoted by \"A ↔ B\") if one of these conditions holds:<br>\r\n(1) A and B have
  the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 ↔ 173.<br>\r\n(2)
  Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 ↔ 223 and
  123 ↔ 23.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe call a prime P a <i>2's relative</i> if there exists
  a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor
  example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:<br>\r\n2
  ↔ 3 ↔ 13 ↔ 113 ↔ 103 ↔ 107 ↔ 127<br>\r\nHowever, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet
  F(N) be the sum of the primes <img src=\"images/symbol_le.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"12\"
  alt=\"≤\" border=\"0\" style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> N which are not 2's relatives.<br>\r\nWe
  can verify that F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 431 and F(10<sup>4</sup>) = 78728.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind
  F(10<sup>7</sup>).\r\n</p>\r\n"
