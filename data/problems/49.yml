:content: "\r\n<p>The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the
  terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are
  prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.</p>\r\n<p>There
  are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting
  this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.</p>\r\n<p>What
  12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?</p>\r\n\r\n"
