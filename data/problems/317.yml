:content: "A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks
  into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all
  of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.\n\nWe assume that the fragments
  move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.\n\nFind
  the volume (in m<sup>3</sup>) of the region through which the fragments move before
  reaching the ground. \rGive your answer rounded to four decimal places.\n\n"
