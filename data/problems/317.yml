:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nA firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground.
  It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction;
  all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe assume
  that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field
  with g=9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind the volume (in m<sup>3</sup>)
  of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. \r\nGive
  your answer rounded to four decimal places.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
