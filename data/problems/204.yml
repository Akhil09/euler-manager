:content: "\r\n<p>A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor
  larger than 5.<br>\r\nSo the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,
  9, 10, 12, 15.<br>\r\nThere are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
  will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type <var>n</var>, if
  it has no prime factor larger than <var>n</var>.<br>\r\nHence the Hamming numbers
  are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many generalised
  Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which don't exceed 10<sup>9</sup>?</p>\r\n"
