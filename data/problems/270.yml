- Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways
  to cut an N<img src="images/symbol_times.gif" width="9" height="9" alt="×" border="0"
  style="vertical-align:middle;">N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30 (shown
  below).
- What is C(30) mod 10<sup>8</sup> ?
