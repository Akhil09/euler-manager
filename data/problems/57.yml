:content: "It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
  an infinite continued fraction.\n\n![âˆš](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_radic.gif)
  2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...\n\nBy expanding this for the
  first four iterations, we get:\n\n1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5  \n\r1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5
  = 1.4  \n\r1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...  \n\r1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2
  + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...\n\nThe next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and
  577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number
  of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.\n\nIn
  the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more
  digits than denominator?\n\n"
