:content: "\r\n<p>The fraction <sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub> is a curious fraction,
  as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe
  that <sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub> = <sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, which is correct,
  is obtained by cancelling the 9s.</p>\r\n<p>We shall consider fractions like, <sup>30</sup>/<sub>50</sub>
  = <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, to be trivial examples.</p>\r\n<p>There are exactly
  four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and
  containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.</p>\r\n<p>If the product
  of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the
  denominator.</p>\r\n\r\n"
