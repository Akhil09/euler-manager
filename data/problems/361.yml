- 'The <b>Thue-Morse sequence</b> {T<sub><var>n</var></sub>} is a binary sequence
  satisfying:'
- "\r\nThe first several terms of {T<sub><var>n</var></sub>} are given as follows:<br>\r\n01101001<span
  style=\"color:red;\">10010</span>1101001011001101001....\r\n"
- "\r\nWe define {A<sub><var>n</var></sub>} as the sorted sequence of integers such
  that the binary expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {T<sub><var>n</var></sub>}.<br>\r\nFor
  example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary. 10010 appears in
  {T<sub><var>n</var></sub>} (T<sub>8</sub> to T<sub>12</sub>), so 18 is an element
  of {A<sub><var>n</var></sub>}.<br>\r\nThe decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110
  in binary. 1110 never appears in {T<sub><var>n</var></sub>}, so 14 is not an element
  of {A<sub><var>n</var></sub>}.\r\n"
- "\r\nThe first several terms of A<sub><var>n</var></sub> are given as follows:<br>"
- "\r\nWe can also verify that A<sub>100</sub> = 3251 and A<sub>1000</sub> = 80852364498.\r\n"
