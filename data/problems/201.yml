:content: "\r\n<p>For any set A of numbers, let sum(A) be the sum of the elements
  of A.<br>\r\nConsider the set B = {1,3,6,8,10,11}.<br> There are 20 subsets of B
  containing three elements, and their sums are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:100px\">\r\nsum({1,3,6})
  = 10,<br>\r\nsum({1,3,8}) = 12,<br>\r\nsum({1,3,10}) = 14,<br>\r\nsum({1,3,11})
  = 15,<br>\r\nsum({1,6,8}) = 15,<br>\r\nsum({1,6,10}) = 17,<br>\r\nsum({1,6,11})
  = 18,<br>\r\nsum({1,8,10}) = 19,<br>\r\nsum({1,8,11}) = 20,<br>\r\nsum({1,10,11})
  = 22,<br>\r\nsum({3,6,8}) = 17,<br>\r\nsum({3,6,10}) = 19,<br>\r\nsum({3,6,11})
  = 20,<br>\r\nsum({3,8,10}) = 21,<br>\r\nsum({3,8,11}) = 22,<br>\r\nsum({3,10,11})
  = 24,<br>\r\nsum({6,8,10}) = 24,<br>\r\nsum({6,8,11}) = 25,<br>\r\nsum({6,10,11})
  = 27,<br>\r\nsum({8,10,11}) = 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these sums occur more than
  once, others are unique.<br>\r\nFor a set A, let U(A,k) be the set of unique sums
  of k-element subsets of A, in our example we find U(B,3) = {10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29}
  and sum(U(B,3)) = 156.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now consider the 100-element set S = {1<sup>2</sup>,
  2<sup>2</sup>, ... , 100<sup>2</sup>}.<br>\r\nS has 100891344545564193334812497256
  50-element subsets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine the sum of all integers which are the
  sum of exactly one of the 50-element subsets of S, i.e. find sum(U(S,50)).</p>\r\n"
