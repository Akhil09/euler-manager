:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nInside a rope of length <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>-1 points
  are placed with distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points,
  we choose <var>m</var>-1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create
  <var>m</var> segments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet E(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>) be the
  expected length of the second-shortest segment.\r\nFor example, E(3, 2) = 2 and
  E(8, 3) = 16/7.\r\nNote that if multiple segments have the same shortest length
  the length of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the shortest
  length.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind E(10<sup>7</sup>, 100).\r\nGive your answer rounded
  to 5 decimal places behind the decimal point.\r\n</p>\r\n"
