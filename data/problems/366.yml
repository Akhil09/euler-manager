:name: Stone Game III
:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nTwo players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.<br>\r\nThere
  is one pile of n stones.<br>\r\nThe first player may remove any positive number
  of stones, but not the whole pile.<br>\r\nThereafter, each player may remove at
  most twice the number of stones his opponent took on the previous move.<br>\r\nThe
  player who removes the last stone wins.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nE.g. n=5<br>\r\nIf the
  first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be able to
  take all remaining stones.<br>\r\nIf the first player takes one stone, leaving four,
  his opponent will take also one stone, leaving three stones.<br>\r\nThe first player
  cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2 stones. So let's say he
  takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player can take the two remaining stones
  and wins.<br>\r\nSo 5 is a losing position for the first player.<br>\r\nFor some
  winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.<br>\r\nE.g.
  when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet
  M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position
  <i>at his first turn</i> and M(n)=0 for any other position.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<img
