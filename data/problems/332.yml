:name: Spherical triangles
:content:
- A <b>spherical triangle</b> is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by three
  <b>great circular arcs</b> intersecting pairwise in three vertices.
- "Let C(<var>r</var>) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius <var>r</var>.<br>\r\nLet
  Z(<var>r</var>) be the set of points on the surface of C(<var>r</var>) with integer
  coordinates.<br>\r\nLet T(<var>r</var>) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices
  in Z(<var>r</var>).\r\nDegenerate spherical triangles, formed by three points on
  the same great arc, are <u>not</u> included in T(<var>r</var>).<br>\r\nLet A(<var>r</var>)
  be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(<var>r</var>)."
- For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.
- Find <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="project/images/p_332_sum.gif"> A(<var>r</var>).
  Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.
