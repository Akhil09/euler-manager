- "\r\nA <b>polygon</b> is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that
  are joined to form a closed chain or circuit. A polygon consists of at least three
  sides and does not self-intersect.\r\n"
- "\r\nA set S of positive numbers is said to <i>generate a polygon</i> P if:"
- "\r\nFor example:<br>\r\nThe set {3, 4, 5} generates a polygon with sides 3, 4,
  and 5 (a triangle).<br>\r\nThe set {6, 9, 11, 24} generates a polygon with sides
  6, 9, 11, and 24 (a quadrilateral).<br>\r\nThe sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4, 9} do
  not generate any polygon at all.<br>"
- "\r\nConsider the sequence s, defined as follows:"
- "\r\nLet U<sub><var>n</var></sub> be the set {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ...,
  s<sub><var>n</var></sub>}. For example, U<sub>10</sub> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13,
  19, 28, 41}.<br>\r\nLet f(<var>n</var>) be the number of subsets of U<sub><var>n</var></sub>
  which generate at least one polygon.<br>\r\nFor example, f(5) = 7, f(10) = 501 and
  f(25) = 18635853.\r\n"
- "\r\nFind the last 9 digits of f(10<sup>18</sup>).\r\n"
