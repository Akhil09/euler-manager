:content: "Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
  without overlap.\n\nAssuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions
  1 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)2, there
  are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.\n\nFor
  this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions <var>a</var>,
  <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>·<var>b</var>.  \n\rWe use
  the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss
  of generality — we add the condition <var>a</var> ![≤](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_le.gif)
  <var>b</var>.\n\nThere is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must
  be no points where corners of four different mats meet.  \n\rFor example, consider
  the two arrangements below for a 4 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)4
  room:\n\n ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_256_tatami3.gif)
  \ \n\nThe arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is
  not: a red \" **X** \" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.\n\nBecause
  of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them
  tatami-free rooms.  \n\rFurther, we define <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) as the number
  of tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var>.\n\nThe smallest tatami-free room has
  size <var>s</var> = 70 and dimensions 7 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)10.
  \ \n\rAll the other rooms of size <var>s</var> = 70 can be covered with tatami;
  they are: 1 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)70,
  2 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)35 and
  5 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)14.  \n\rHence,
  <var>T</var>(70) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, we can verify that <var>T</var>(1320) = 5 because
  there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var> = 1320:  \n\r20 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)66,
  22 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)60,
  24 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)55,
  30 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)44 and
  33 ![×](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/symbol_times.gif)40.
  \ \n\rIn fact, <var>s</var> = 1320 is the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which
  <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 5.\n\nFind the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for
  which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 200.\n\n"
