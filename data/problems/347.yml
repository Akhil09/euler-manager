:content: "The largest integer ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 100 that is only
  divisible by both the primes 2 and 3 is 96, as 96=32\\*3=2<sup>5</sup>\\*3.\rFor
  two _distinct_ primes p and q let M(p,q,N) be the largest positive integer ![≤]({{
  images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif)N only divisible\rby both p and q and M(p,q,N)=0 if
  such a positive integer does not exist.\n\nE.g. M(2,3,100)=96.  \n \rM(3,5,100)=75
  and not 90 because 90 is divisible by 2 ,3 and 5.  \n\rAlso M(2,73,100)=0 because
  there does not exist a positive integer ![≤]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_le.gif) 100
  that is divisible by both 2 and 73.\n\nLet S(N) be the sum of all distinct M(p,q,N).\rS(100)=2262.\n\nFind
  S(10 000 000).\n\n"
