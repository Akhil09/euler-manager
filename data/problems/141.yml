:name: Investigating progressive numbers, <i>n</i>, which are also square

:content: "\r\n<p>A positive integer, <i>n</i>, is divided by <i>d</i> and the quotient
  and remainder are <i>q</i> and <i>r</i> respectively. In addition <i>d</i>, <i>q</i>,
  and <i>r</i> are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but
  not necessarily in that order.</p>\r\n<p>For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient
  9 and remainder 4. It can also be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric
  sequence (common ratio 3/2).<br>\r\nWe will call such numbers, <i>n</i>, progressive.</p>\r\n<p>Some
  progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 102<sup>2</sup>, happen to also be perfect
  squares.<br> The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand
  is 124657.</p>\r\n<p>Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion
  (10<sup>12</sup>).</p>\r\n\r\n"
