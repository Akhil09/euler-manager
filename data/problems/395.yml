:content: "The **Pythagorean tree** is a fractal generated by the following procedure:\n\nStart
  with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the animation, the
  bottom side is the base):\n\n1. Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the
  base, with the hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5
  ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the 'right' side with
  respect to the base (see animation).\n2. Attach a square to each leg of the right
  triangle, with one of its sides coinciding with that leg.\n3. Repeat this procedure
  for both squares, considering as their bases the sides touching the triangle.\n\rThe
  resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the Pythagorean tree.\r\r\r\n
  ![](/home/will/src/euler-manager/config/../data/images/p_395_pythagorean.gif)\n\nIt
  can be shown that there exists at least one rectangle, whose sides are parallel
  to the largest square of the Pythagorean tree, which encloses the Pythagorean tree
  completely.\n\nFind the smallest area possible for such a bounding rectangle, and
  give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.\n\n"
