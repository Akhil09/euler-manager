:content: "\r\n<p>\r\nThe <b>Pythagorean tree</b> is a fractal generated by the following
  procedure:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStart with a unit square. Then, calling one of
  the sides its base (in the animation, the bottom side is the base):\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>
  Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the hypotenuse coinciding
  with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5 ratio. Note that the smaller side of
  the triangle must be on the 'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).</li>\r\n<li>
  Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its sides coinciding
  with that leg.</li>\r\n<li> Repeat this procedure for both squares, considering
  as their bases the sides touching the triangle.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe resulting figure,
  after an infinite number of iterations, is the Pythagorean tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div
  align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p_395_pythagorean.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt
  can be shown that there exists at least one rectangle, whose sides are parallel
  to the largest square of the Pythagorean tree, which encloses the Pythagorean tree
  completely.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFind the smallest area possible for such a bounding
  rectangle, and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.\r\n</p>\r\n"
