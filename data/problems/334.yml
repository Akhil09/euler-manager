- "In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.<br>\r\nEach
  bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.<br>\r\nA child plays
  a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and
  putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.<br> The game ends when each bowl
  contains either one or no beans."
- 'For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively,
  all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:'
- You are given the following sequences:<br>
- "The first two terms of the last sequence are <var>b</var><sub><i>1</i></sub> =
  289 and <var>b</var><sub><i>2</i></sub> = 145.<br>\r\nIf we start with <var>b</var><sub><i>1</i></sub>
  and <var>b</var><sub><i>2</i></sub> beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves would
  be required to finish the game."
- Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing <var>b</var><sub><i>1</i></sub>, <var>b</var><sub><i>2</i></sub>,...,
  <var>b</var><sub><i>1500</i></sub> beans respectively, all other bowls being empty.
  Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.
