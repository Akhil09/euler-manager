:content: "\r\n<p>\"<i>The Chase</i>\" is a game played with two dice and an even
  number of players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The players sit around a table; the game begins
  with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with
  a die roll it.<br>\r\nIf a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour
  on the left; if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise,
  he keeps the die for the next turn.<br>\r\nThe game ends when one player has both
  dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
  a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts?</p>\r\n<p>Give
  your answer rounded to ten significant digits.</p>\r\n"
