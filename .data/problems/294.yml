:content: "For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in
  its usual decimal representation.\rThus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.\n\nFor a positive integer
  n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k n with the following properties
  :\n\n- k is divisible by 23 and\r\n- d(k) = 23.\r\n\r\rYou are given that S(9) =
  263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.\r\r\n\nFind S(11<sup>12</sup>) and give your
  answer mod 10<sup>9</sup>.\n\n"
