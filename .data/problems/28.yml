:content: "Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction
  a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:\n\n**21** 22 23 24 **25**  \n\r20   **7**
   8   **9** 10  \n\r19  6   **1**  2 11  \n\r18   **5**  4   **3** 12  \n**17** 16
  15 14 **13**\n\nIt can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals
  is 101.\n\nWhat is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral
  formed in the same way?\n\n"
