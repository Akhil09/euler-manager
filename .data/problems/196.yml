  . .\n\nEach positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.\n\nA set
  of three primes is called a _prime triplet_ if one of the three primes has the other
  two as neighbours in the triangle.\n\nFor example, in the second row, the prime
  numbers 2 and 3 are elements of some prime triplet.\n\nIf row 8 is considered, it
  contains two primes which are elements of some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.  \n\rIf
  row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element of some prime
  triplet: 37.\n\nDefine S(<var>n</var>) as the sum of the primes in row <var>n</var>
  which are elements of any prime triplet.  \n\rThen S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.\n\nYou are
  given that S(10000)=950007619.\n\nFind  S(5678027) + S(7208785).\n\n"
