:content: " **Bozo sort** , not to be confused with the slightly less efficient **bogo
  sort** , consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not swapping
  randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the sequence is sorted.\n\nIf
  we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the expectation
  value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input sequences is 24.75.  \n\rThe
  already sorted sequence takes 0 steps.\n\nIn this problem we consider the following
  variant on bozo sort.  \n\rIf the sequence is not in order we pick three elements
  at random and shuffle these three elements randomly.  \n\rAll 3!=6 permutations
  of those three elements are equally likely.   \n\rThe already sorted sequence will
  take 0 steps.  \n\rIf we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers
  as input the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4! input
  sequences is 27.5.   \n\rConsider as input sequences the permutations of the first
  11 natural numbers.  \n\rAveraged over all 11! input sequences, what is the expected
  number of shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?\n\nGive your answer rounded
  to the nearest integer.\n\n"
