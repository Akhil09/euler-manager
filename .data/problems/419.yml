:content: "The **look and say** sequence goes 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221,
  1113213211, ...  \n\rThe sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained
  by describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.  \n\rIt helps
  to do this out loud:  \n\r1 is 'one one' ![→]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_maps.gif)
  11  \n\r11 is 'two ones' ![→]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_maps.gif) 21  \n\r21 is 'one
  two and one one' ![→]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_maps.gif) 1211   \n\r1211 is 'one
  one, one two and two ones' ![→]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_maps.gif) 111221  \n\r111221
  is 'three ones, two twos and one one' ![→]({{ images_dir }}/symbol_maps.gif) 312211
  \ \n\r...\n\nDefine A(n), B(n) and C(n) as the number of ones, twos and threes in
  the n'th element of the sequence respectively.  \n\rOne can verify that A(40) =
  31254, B(40) = 20259 and C(40) = 11625.\n\nFind A(n), B(n) and C(n) for n = 10<sup>12</sup>.
  \ \n \rGive your answer modulo 2<sup>30</sup> and separate your values for A, B
  and C by a comma.  \n \rE.g. for n = 40 the answer would be 31254,20259,11625\n\n"
