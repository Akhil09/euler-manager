:content: "Consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.  \n\rEvery number
  from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of distinct divisors of 6:
  \ \n\r1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.  \n\rA number <var>n</var> is called a
  practical number if every number from 1 up to and including <var>n</var> can be
  expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of <var>n</var>.\n\nA pair of consecutive
  prime numbers with a difference of six is called a sexy pair (since \"sex\" is the
  Latin word for \"six\"). The first sexy pair is (23, 29).\n\nWe may occasionally
  find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy prime pairs, such that the
  second member of each pair is the first member of the next pair.\n\nWe shall call
  a number <var>n</var> such that :\n\n- (<var>n</var>-9, <var>n</var>-3), (<var>n</var>-3,<var>n</var>+3),
  (<var>n</var>+3, <var>n</var>+9) form a triple-pair, and \r\n- the numbers <var>n</var>-8,
  <var>n</var>-4, <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>+4 and <var>n</var>+8 are all practical,\r\n
  \ran engineers’ paradise.\r\r\n\nFind the sum of the first four engineers’ paradises.\n\n"
